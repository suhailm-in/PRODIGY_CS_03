# Image Encryption and Decryption Tool

This is a simple Python script that evaluates the strength of a password based on several criteria, including length, use of uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, and special characters. It provides feedback on how strong or weak a password is and gives suggestions for improvement.

## Features

**Checks password strength** based on five key criteria:

1. Password length (minimum of 12 characters)
2. At least one uppercase letter
3. At least one lowercase letter
4. At least one digit
5. At least one special character (e.g., `!@#$%^&*()`)

**Provides a score out of 5** based on the criteria that are met. </br>
**Gives feedback** to help improve password strength.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## Installation

1. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.
2. Download or Clone the repository:
```bash

```

# Usage

## Example

Enter a password to check its strength: SecurePass!2024

Password Strength Analysis: </br>
Length (>= 12 characters): YES </br>
Uppercase Letters: YES </br>
Lowercase Letters: YES </br>
Digits: YES </br>
Special Characters: YES </br>

Overall Score: 5/5 </br>
Feedback: Strong Password :) </br>

## Password Strength Criteria

The password strength is evaluated based on the following factors:

1. Length: The password must be at least 12 characters long.
2. Uppercase Letters: The password must include at least one uppercase letter.
3. Lowercase Letters: The password must include at least one lowercase letter.
4. Digits: The password must include at least one digit.
5. Special Characters: The password must include at least one special character (e.g., !@#$%^&*()).

## Feedback and Scoring

- Score: 5/5: Strong Password :)
- Score: 4/5: Good password, but could be stronger with additional complexity.
- Score: 3/5: Moderate password. Consider increasing length and adding more complexity.
- Score: 2/5: Weak password. Try to use a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters.
- Score: 1/5 or 0/5: Very weak password. Consider using a longer password with diverse characters.
